# Language_Visualiser
Final assignment for CS3012

Part 1 of the assignment works perfectly, a user is queried and information from the github api about the user is given.

However for the graph section of part 2 I couldnt get the d3.graph to populate correctly and display the correct data.

I had planned to have the graph to the right of the repository list and display which language the user develops in the most by measuring commits per repository.

My attempted code can be found in the app.js file in the plot, getdata and commitHistory functions.
Apologies for being unable to complete the final section.

Current implementation can be found at https://fowleyt.github.io/Language_Visualiser/ .
